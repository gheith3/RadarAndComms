        In radar systems, receiver sensitivity is a crucial parameter used to calculate 
        the noise floor and sensitivity of the radar system. Understanding the significance
        of receiver sensitivity and how it is utilized in determining the noise floor and 
        sensitivity values is essential for optimizing radar performance. This article 
        explores the importance of receiver sensitivity and provides insights into the 
        calculations involved in determining the noise floor and sensitivity in dBm (decibel-milliwatts).

<ContentCard Title="What Is For?">

    <LongTextBlock Title="Noise Floor Calculation" Mb="3">
        Receiver sensitivity plays a pivotal role in determining the noise floor of a radar system.
        The noise floor represents the minimum detectable signal level in the presence of noise.
        By accurately calculating the noise floor, radar operators can establish the 
        system's sensitivity to detect weak signals amidst background noise. 
        This knowledge helps in setting appropriate detection thresholds and 
        optimizing radar performance.

    <LongTextBlock Title="Sensitivity Calculation" Mb="3">
        Receiver sensitivity is also utilized to determine the sensitivity of a radar system. 
        Sensitivity refers to the minimum detectable signal power required for reliable target detection.
        By knowing the receiver sensitivity, operators can determine the system's capability to
        detect targets with specific power levels. This information is crucial for assessing the
        radar's effectiveness in different operational scenarios.

<ContentCard Title="Calculation">
    <LongTextBlock Title="Noise Floor (dBm)" Mb="3">
        The noise floor can be calculated by adding the receiver sensitivity and the system's noise figure. The formula for noise floor in dBm is:
        Noise Floor (dBm) = Receiver Sensitivity (dBm) + Noise Figure (dB).
    </LongTextBlock>
    <LongTextBlock Title="Sensitivity (dBm)" Mb="3">
        The sensitivity of a radar system can be calculated by subtracting the receiver sensitivity from the system's gain. The formula for sensitivity in dBm is:
        Sensitivity (dBm) = System Gain (dB) - Receiver Sensitivity (dBm).
