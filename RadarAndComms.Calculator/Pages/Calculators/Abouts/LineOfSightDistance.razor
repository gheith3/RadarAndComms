<ContentCard Title="What Is For?">

    <LongTextBlock Title="Accurate Target Localization" Mb="3">
        Determining the line-of-sight distance between a radar and its target allows for precise
        target localization in three-dimensional space. It enables radar operators to determine
        the target's range, azimuth, and elevation accurately, facilitating effective tracking
        and engagement.
    </LongTextBlock>


    <LongTextBlock Title="Target Identification and Classification" Mb="3">
        The line-of-sight distance aids in differentiating between multiple targets in the radar's
        field of view. By calculating the distance, operators can identify and classify targets
        based on their range, which is crucial for distinguishing between friend and foe or
        differentiating between aircraft, ships, or ground vehicles.
    </LongTextBlock>


    <LongTextBlock Title="Assessing Radar Performance" Mb="3">
        Calculating the line-of-sight distance helps evaluate the performance of a radar system.
        By comparing the expected range with the measured range, operators can identify any
        discrepancies and assess the radar's accuracy, sensitivity, and calibration.
    </LongTextBlock>

    <LongTextBlock Title="Radar Horizon Analysis" Mb="3">
        Understanding the line-of-sight distance is essential
        for radar horizon analysis. It allows operators to determine the maximum range at
        which the radar can detect targets based on the curvature of the Earth and factors
        such as antenna height and target altitude. This information is crucial for
        optimizing radar coverage and determining surveillance capabilities.

<ContentCard Title="Calculation">
    <LongTextBlock Title="D1" Mb="3">
        Line-of-Sight Distance in Kilometers:<br />
        d1 = c * t / 2000 <br />
        where d1 represents the line-of-sight distance in kilometers, c is the speed of light in kilometers per second (approximately 299,792 km/s), and t is the round-trip time of the radar signal in seconds.
    </LongTextBlock>
    <LongTextBlock Title="D2" Mb="3">
        Line-of-Sight Distance in Nautical Miles: <br />
        d2 = c * t / 1852 <br />
        where d2 represents the line-of-sight distance in nautical miles. The speed of light is still denoted as c, and t is the round-trip time in seconds.
    </LongTextBlock>

    <LongTextBlock Title="LOS Dist Km" Mb="3">
        Line-of-Sight Distance in Kilometers using GPS: <br />
        LOS km = 2 * R * arcsin(√(sin²((lat2-lat1)/2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin²((lon2-lon1)/2))) <br />
        where LOS km represents the line-of-sight distance in kilometers, R is the radius of the Earth (approximately 6371 km), lat1 and lon1 are the latitude and longitude of the radar position, and lat2 and lon2 are the latitude and longitude of the target position.
    </LongTextBlock>
    <LongTextBlock Title="LOS Dist Nm" Mb="3">
        Line-of-Sight Distance in Nautical Miles using GPS: <br />
        LOS nm = LOS km / 1.852 <br />
        where LOS nm represents the line-of-sight distance in nautical miles.
