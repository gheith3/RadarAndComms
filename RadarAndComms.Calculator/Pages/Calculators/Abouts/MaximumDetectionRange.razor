        The maximum detection range is a critical parameter in radar systems,
        representing the maximum distance at which a target can be detected reliably.
        Several factors contribute to the determination of the maximum detection range,
        including transmitted power (Pt), antenna gains (Gt and Gr),
        radar cross-section (RCS), number of pulses, frequency (f),
        minimum detectable signal (MDS) power (Prx), loss (L), and the
        logarithmic range equation (40logR). This article explores these
        factors and their relationships to understand the concept of maximum
        detection range in radar systems.

<ContentCard Title="What Is For?">
    <ContentCard Title="Transmitted Power, Antenna Gains, and RCS">
        <LongTextBlock Title="Transmitted Power (Pt)" Mb="3">
            refers to the power level at which the radar
            system transmits the signal. It is typically measured in kilowatts (kW)
            and can also be expressed in decibel-milliwatts (dBm).
        </LongTextBlock>
        <LongTextBlock Title="Transmitted Power (Pt in dBm)" Mb="3">
            To convert transmitted power from kilowatts (kW) to decibel-milliwatts (dBm),
            the following formula is used:<br />
            Pt (dBm) = 10 * log10(Pt / 0.001) <br />
            where Pt is the transmitted power in kilowatts.
        </LongTextBlock>
        <LongTextBlock Title="Antenna Gain (Gt and Gr)" Mb="3">
            Antenna gain measures the directional concentration of radiated or received power.
            The gain of the transmitting antenna (Gt) and the receiving antenna (Gr)
            are usually expressed in decibels relative to an isotropic radiator (dBi).
            Antenna gain accounts for the ability of the antennas to focus signal power
            in specific directions.
        </LongTextBlock>
        <LongTextBlock Title="Radar Cross-Section (RCS)" Mb="3">
            The radar cross-section (RCS) is a measure of the target's ability to reflect
            radar signals. It is typically expressed in decibel square meters (dBsm)
            or decibel-milliwatts (dBm). A higher RCS value indicates a stronger
            reflection of the radar signal, making the target more detectable.

    <ContentCard Title="Number of Pulses, Frequency, and MDS Prx">
        <LongTextBlock Title="Number of Pulses" Mb="3">
            The number of pulses refers to the quantity of transmitted
            pulses during radar operation. Increasing the number of pulses
            can enhance target detection by improving signal-to-noise ratio
            and reducing the effects of interference.
        </LongTextBlock>

        <LongTextBlock Title="Frequency (f)" Mb="3">
            represents the rate at which the radar signal
            oscillates and is typically measured in gigahertz (GHz). The
            frequency of the signal affects its propagation characteristics and
            determines the system's resolution and sensitivity.
        </LongTextBlock>

        <LongTextBlock Title="Minimum Detectable Signal (MDS) Power (Prx)" Mb="3">
            The MDS power (Prx) represents the minimum power level that
            the radar system can detect reliably. It is expressed in
            decibel-milliwatts (dBm) and depends on factors such as receiver
            sensitivity, noise figure, and system design.
        </LongTextBlock>

    <ContentCard Title="Loss, 40logR, and Range (R)">

        <LongTextBlock Title="Loss (L)" Mb="3">
            Loss (L) accounts for the reduction in signal power due to various
            factors during propagation, including free space loss, atmospheric
            absorption, and obstacles. Loss is typically expressed in decibels 
            (dB) and is subtracted from the received power to determine the
            effective power at a given range.
        </LongTextBlock>

        <LongTextBlock Title="Logarithmic Range Equation (40logR)" Mb="3">
            The logarithmic range equation, expressed as 40logR, quantifies the
            power loss with increasing distance from the radar. It considers
            the inverse square law and accounts for the spreading of the radar 
            signal energy in three-dimensional space.
        </LongTextBlock>

        <LongTextBlock Title="Range (R in km)" Mb="3">
            Range (R) refers to the distance between the radar system and the 
            target. It is typically measured in kilometers (km) and plays
            a crucial role in determining the maximum detection range.

        The maximum detection range in radar systems is influenced by various factors,
        including transmitted power (Pt), antenna gains (Gt and Gr), 
        radar cross-section (RCS), number of pulses, frequency (f), 
        minimum detectable signal (MDS) power (Prx), loss (L),
        and the logarithmic range equation (40logR). 
        Understanding the relationships between these 
        factors helps optimize radar system performance and ensures 
        reliable target detection at maximum ranges.
