        is a fundamental concept in wireless communication systems
        and radar applications, representing the attenuation of signal power as
        it propagates through free space. Understanding the elements involved in
        free space loss calculations, such as transmitted power (Pt), antenna gains (Gt and Gr),
        frequency (f), range (R), loss (L), received power (Prx), sensitivity,
        and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), is crucial for optimizing system performance and
        ensuring reliable communication. This article explores these elements and their roles
        in calculating free space loss and evaluating system capabilities.

<ContentCard Title="What Is For?">

    <ContentCard Title="Transmitted Power and Antenna Gains">
        <LongTextBlock Title="Transmitted Power (Pt)" Mb="3">
            Transmitted power (Pt) is the power level at which the signal is transmitted from the antenna.
            It is typically measured in watts (W) and can also be expressed in decibel-milliwatts (dBm).
        </LongTextBlock>

        <LongTextBlock Title="Transmitted Power (Pt in dBm)" Mb="3">
            To convert transmitted power from watts (W) to decibel-milliwatts (dBm),
            the following formula is used:
            Pt (dBm) = 10 * log10(Pt / 0.001),
            where Pt is the transmitted power in watts.
        </LongTextBlock>

        <LongTextBlock Title="Antenna Gain (Gt and Gr)" Mb="3">
            Antenna gain measures the directional concentration of radiated or received power.
            The gain of the transmitting antenna (Gt) and the receiving antenna (Gr) are usually
            expressed in decibels relative to an isotropic radiator (dBi). Antenna gain accounts
            for the ability of the antennas to focus signal power in specific directions.

    <ContentCard Title="Frequency, Range, and Loss">
        <LongTextBlock Title="Frequency (f)" Mb="3">
            Frequency (f) represents the rate at which the electromagnetic wave oscillates and is
            typically measured in megahertz (MHz). The frequency of the signal affects its
            propagation characteristics and determines the wavelength.
        </LongTextBlock>

        <LongTextBlock Title="Range (R)" Mb="3">
            Range (R) refers to the distance between the transmitter and receiver. In free space
            loss calculations, it is usually expressed in kilometers (km).
        </LongTextBlock>

        <LongTextBlock Title="Loss (L)" Mb="3">
            Loss (L) represents the reduction in signal power due to various factors during propagation.
            It includes free space loss, as well as losses caused by atmospheric absorption, obstacles,
            and other environmental factors. Loss is typically expressed in decibels (dB).
        </LongTextBlock>
    </ContentCard>

    <ContentCard Title="Received Power, Sensitivity, and SNR">
        <LongTextBlock Title="Received Power (Prx)" Mb="3">
        Received power (Prx) is the power level of the signal at the receiving antenna. It is affected by the transmitted power, antenna gains, free space loss, and other losses in the propagation path. Prx is generally measured in decibel-milliwatts (dBm).
        </LongTextBlock>
        <LongTextBlock Title="Sensitivity" Mb="3">
        Sensitivity refers to the minimum power level required at the receiver to reliably detect and demodulate the incoming signal. It is expressed in decibel-milliwatts (dBm) and plays a crucial role in determining the system's ability to detect weak signals.
        </LongTextBlock>
        <LongTextBlock Title="Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)" Mb="3">
        Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) represents the ratio of the power of the useful signal (received power) to the power of the background noise. It is expressed in decibels (dB) and is a measure of the quality of the received signal.
